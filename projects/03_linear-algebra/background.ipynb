    "## Part 3: Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to solve linear algebra problems using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).\n",
    "Simply put, linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that solves\n",
    "multidimensional problems using matrices and vectors.\n",
    "These types of problems arise in many different fields (biology, economics, physics,\n",
    "etc.), so this is one of the most practical branches of mathematics that there\n",
    "is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use springs as a toy example for getting an intuitive grasp of the\n",
    "meaning of various operations in linear algebra.\n",
    "Let us begin by reviewing the one-dimensional case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review: 1-Dimensional Spring Oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hooke's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "In your physics class, you may have discussed Hooke's law, which states that the\n",
    "force on a spring displaced from its equilibrium length has a magnitude\n",
    "proportional to its displacement and a direction opposite to its displacement.\n",
    "This is called a \"restoring force\", because it acts to *restore* the equilibrium\n",
    "length of the spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a spring fixed at one and stretched to a position $x$ along the\n",
    "$x$-axis, relative to its equilibrium position $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![1d-spring](../../.github/1d-spring-hookes-law.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is described by the following equation.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  f(x)\n",
    "  = - k (x - x_0)\n",
    "  = - k \\, \\Delta x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "To see how this corresponds to Hooke's law, consider what happens to the force\n",
    "for $x < x_0$ (compression), $x = x_0$ (equilibrium), and $x > x_0$ (extension).\n",
    "The constant $k$ is the \"spring constant\", a physical property of the spring\n",
    "describing how strongly it resists displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Quadratic Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "On [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law), you will read that\n",
    "\"Hooke's law is only a first-order linear approximation to the real response of\n",
    "springs and other elastic bodies to applied forces.\"\n",
    "We will see that this linear approximation to the force corresponds to a\n",
    "quadratic approximation of the potential energy.\n",
    "To see this, recall that a conservative force, $f(x)$, is equal to the negative\n",
    "first derivative of the potential energy of the system, $V(x)$.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  f(x)\n",
    "  =\n",
    "  -\n",
    "  \\frac{\\partial V(x)}{\\partial x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For small displacements, the potential can be approximated by a second-order\n",
    "quadratic [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem) about its equilibrium value.\n",
    "Furthermore, since $\\frac{\\partial V(x_0)}{\\partial x} = - f(x_0) = 0$, the first-order term drops out.\n",
    "This leaves the following potential.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  V(x)\n",
    "  \\approx\n",
    "  V(x_0)\n",
    "  +\n",
    "  \\frac{1}{2}\n",
    "  \\frac{\\partial^2 V(x_0)}{\\partial x^2}\n",
    "  \\Delta x^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "By definition, the equilibrium value must be a minimum of the potential energy,\n",
    "so this potential has the shape of an upward parabola centered at $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![1d-spring-potential](../../.github/1d-spring-hookes-law-quadratic-potential.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting this into the force equation above gives us the \"first-order linear\n",
    "approximation\" of the force referenced by the quote.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  f(x)\n",
    "  =\n",
    "  -\n",
    "  \\frac{\\partial^2 V(x_0)}{\\partial x^2}\n",
    "  \\Delta x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Comparing this with Hooke's law gives a simple interpretation of the spring\n",
    "constant as the second derivative of the potential energy at equilibrium,\n",
    "$k =\\frac{\\partial^2 V(x_0)}{\\partial x^2}$.\n",
    "As pointed out by the quote, this is an *approximation* that is valid specifically\n",
    "for displacements that are small relative to the shape of the quadratic well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Algebra: $n$-Dimensional Spring Oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "The above strategy of approximating the potential energy as quadratic around an\n",
    "equilibrium value can be generalized to any number of dimensions, and we can\n",
    "gain physical insight by analogy to the spring oscillator.\n"
